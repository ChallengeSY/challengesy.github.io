<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h4>How do I reset race specifications?</h4>
<p>Use the buttons near the top of each table to adjust multiple checkboxes at once. Each button does a different set of checkboxes.</p>

<h4>How do I edit my resources?</h4>
<p>The numbers in the <strong>Your Resources</strong> row are styled text fields. You can type your own stockpiles in, and see what you are missing. Alternatively, you can use API Connect to store a memory of your personalized megacredit total that will be loaded automatically for the remainder of your browser session.</p>

<!--
<h4>Why does API Connect mention Matchmaking Pool?</h4>
<p>The API Connect mechanism was originally built for a potential revival of the Matchmaking Pool. We have discovered another use of the mechanism that allows us to extract a megacredits amount that your session will default to when you connect this way.</p>

<h4>How come the welcome window keeps popping up?</h4>
<p>The <strong>Campaign Tech Simulator</strong> uses a cookie to remember your visit. If you did not accept (or recently cleared) the cookies, this can happen. It can also happen because it has been more than 30 days since you last used one of the simulators, resulting in an expired cookie.</p>
