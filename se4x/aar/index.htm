<h2 id="intro">AAR Intro: A doomed journey</h2>
<p>Welcome to an After Action Report (or simply an AAR) of a <a href="javaScript:showBox('space empires 4x')">Space Empires 4X</a> Doomsday Machine solitaire scenario, played on Normal difficulty. The objective of this scenario is to destroy 3 <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM');">Doomsday Machines</a> while protecting the <a href="javaScript:showBox('homeworld')">homeworld</a>. If any machine reaches the homeworld, any defending ships present will have one last chance to destroy the machine. If they fail, the homeworld becomes destroyed, ending the scenario in defeat for the player.</p>

<script>dispImage("doomsdayMachine.jpg","Doomsday Machine counter")</script>

<p>A typical homeworld setup consists of the <a href="javaScript:showBox('homeworld')">home colony</a>, 4 <a href="javaScript:showBox('SY');">Ship Yards</a>, 3 <a href="javaScript:showBox('SC');">Scouts</a>, 3 <a href="javaScript:showBox('CO');">Colony Ships</a>, and 1 <a href="javaScript:showBox('miner')">Mining Ship</a>. Surrounding their home hex (in this case, L7) is a series of <a href="javaScript:showBox('unexplored');">unexplored systems</a>. Ideally, that is where the Scouts come in, as they are the least expensive combat ship to build.</p>

<p>Some of these unexplored systems have a border matching a player's color <span class="bindTxt">(in this case, red)</span>. These represent the <a href="javaScript:showBox('home system')">home systems</a> surrounding a homeworld. Past this neighborhood is a series of <a href="javaScript:showBox('deep space')">deep space</a> systems, depicted with a white border. (Small tip: Starting forces counters can be packed together with the home system markers in between games to save setup time.)</p>

<script>dispImage("homeworldSetup.jpg","Typical homeworld setup")</script>

<h2 id="ep1">Up to Economic Phase 1</h2>
<p>The <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM2');">first Doomsday Machine</a> will not appear for 7 <a href="javaScript:showBox('economic phase')">economic phases</a> on Normal difficulty. Ideally, this time should be used to build a fleet able to destroy these machines and achieve victory.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(0)</script>

<p>Most of the systems uncovered during exploration are <a href="javaScript:showBox('minerals')">minerals</a>, worth 5 CP each; allowing for plenty of opportunities to gain money. A single <a href="javaScript:showBox('planet')">planet</a> (L8) and <a href="javaScript:showBox('asteroids')">asteroid belt</a> (K6) were also discovered, each 1 hex away from the <a href="javaScript:showBox('homeworld')">homeworld</a>. The former allows use of one of the <a href="javaScript:showBox('CO');">Colony Ships</a>. Finally; venturing into <a href="javaScript:showBox('deep space')">deep space</a> early, a <a href="javaScript:showBox('supernova')">super nova</a> was discovered, inhibiting further exploration.</p>

<p>During the economic phase, production (+20 CP) and <a href="javaScript:showBox('maintenance')">maintenance</a> (-3 CP) have taken place. One of the minerals was also towed home (+5 CP). Next, <a href="javaScript:showBox('ship size')">Ship Size</a> <a href="javaScript:showBox('tech')">technology</a> (or simply tech) level 2 was purchased (-10 CP). Afterwards, 2 more <a href="javaScript:showBox('SC');">Scouts</a> (-12 CP) were built, leaving a leftover balance of 0 CP.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(1)</script>

<h2 id="ep2">Up to Economic Phase 2</h2>
<p>After coming off to a great start, more exploration takes place, uncovering a variety of system types, including the first <a href="javaScript:showBox('minerals')">minerals</a> that yield 10 CP each, <a href="javaScript:showBox('nebula')">nebulae</a>, <a href="javaScript:showBox('barren')">barren planets</a>. Tragedy also struck this set of <a href="javaScript:showBox('movement turn')">movement turns</a>, exposing the first two <a href="javaScript:showBox('danger')">Danger!</a> hexes of the playthrough... instantly destroying 2 <a href="javaScript:showBox('SC');">Scouts</a> (1 in each). One more <a href="javaScript:showBox('planet')">planet</a> was discovered, allowing use of another <a href="javaScript:showBox('CO');">Colony Ship</a>.</p>

<script>dispImage("firstDanger.jpg","First Danger marker")</script>

<p>During the economic phase, production (+21 CP), <a href="javaScript:showBox('minerals')">minerals</a> (+5 CP), and <a href="javaScript:showBox('maintenance')">maintenance</a> (-3 CP) have taken place. Afterwards, 1 Scout (-6 CP), 1 <a href="javaScript:showBox('miner')">Mining Ship</a> (-5 CP), and 1 Colony Ship (-8 CP) were built, leaving a leftover balance of 4 CP.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(2)</script>

<h2 id="ep3">Up to Economic Phase 3</h2>

<p>Although it is fortunate to still have 4 <a href="javaScript:showBox('SC');">Scouts</a> to work with, the recent losses have certainly slowed down exploration. Many <a href="javaScript:showBox('home system')">home systems</a> remain <a href="javaScript:showBox('unexplored');">unexplored</a> as we speak. Yet, exploration remains relatively fruitful, having exposed a <a href="javaScript:showBox('space wreck')">space wreck</a> in the process...</p>

<p>... followed by one of the Scouts being <a href="javaScript:showBox('lost')">lost in space</a>. This was one of the areas where it was unclear how to handle it, since this is a solitaire scenario. For this one, a random spectator was given the opportunity to send this ship, and they moved it northwest of the offending hex. In other news, 2 more Scouts bite the dust to <a href="javaScript:showBox('danger')">Danger</a> hexes, and multiple <a href="javaScript:showBox('planet')">planets</a> were discovered, greatly opening up colonization options.</p>

<script>dispImage("lostInSpace1.jpg","Lost In Space")</script>

<p>During economics, production (+24 CP), <a href="javaScript:showBox('minerals')">minerals</a> (+10 CP), and maintenance (-2 CP) have taken place. 3 Scouts (-18 CP), and 2 <a href="javaScript:showBox('CO');">Colony Ships</a> (-16 CP) were built, leaving a leftover balance of 2 CP. (In hindsight, this wouldn't been legal at the time due to only 4 <a href="javaScript:showBox('SY');">Ship Yard</a> capacity. We had forgotten about this capacity limit at the time.)</p>

<script>ecoPhase(3)</script>

<h2 id="ep4">Up to Economic Phase 4</h2>

<p>With the <a href="javaScript:showBox('SC');">Scouts</a> rebuilt, more possibilities await... at least, if two more <a href="javaScript:showBox('danger')">danger</a> hexes weren't exposed over the course of this set of <a href="javaScript:showBox('movement turn')">movement turns</a>.</p>

<p>Just before those incidents took place, the first <a href="javaScript:showBox('black hole')">black hole</a> hex was found. Although a persistant hazard, at least it does not guarantee destruction. Sure enough, a 4 was rolled on this. Compared to a 6 or less, the Scout lived to see another turn... even if it got destroyed the next movement turn.</p>

<script>dispImage("blackHole.jpg","First Black Hole marker")</script>

<p>During economics, production (+30 CP), minerals (+5 CP), and maintenance (-3 CP) have taken place. Next, <a href="javaScript:showBox('ship size')">Ship Size</a> level 3 was purchased (-15 CP). Afterwards, 1 <a href="javaScript:showBox('CO');">Colony Ship</a> (-8 CP) was built at the <a href="javaScript:showBox('homeworld')">homeworld</a>, while 1 <a href="javaScript:showBox('SY');">Ship Yard</a> (-6 CP) was built at a nearby <a href="javaScript:showBox('colony')">colony</a> (J8) to act as a forward base. This leaves 5 CP leftover.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(4)</script>

<h2 id="ep5">Up to Economic Phase 5</h2>

<p>During movement, a few more systems get explored, including another <a href="javaScript:showBox('danger')">danger</a> hex claiming one <a href="javaScript:showBox('SC');">Scout</a>, and a <a href="javaScript:showBox('black hole')">black hole</a> claiming another (9 &gt; 6). Perhaps most usefully, one of the <a href="javaScript:showBox('miner')">Mining Ships</a> is towing a <a href="javaScript:showBox('space wreck')">space wreck</a>. This will take a bit longer before it can be cashed in.</p>

<p>During economics, production (+38 CP), and maintenance (-1 CP) have taken place. Next, <a href="javaScript:showBox('attack')">Attack</a> tech level 1 (-20 CP) and <a href="javaScript:showBox('tactics')">Tactics</a> <a href="javaScript:showBox('tech')">tech</a> level 1 (-15 CP) were purchased. Finally, 1 <a href="javaScript:showBox('SY');">Ship Yard</a> (-6 CP) was built at the very same <a href="javaScript:showBox('colony')">colony</a> at J8, doubling the forward colony's construction capacity. This leaves 1 CP leftover.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(5)</script>

<h2 id="ep6">Up to Economic Phase 6</h2>

<p>We are low on time at this point in the playthrough before the <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM2');">first Doomsday Machine</a> appears on the map. We are also low on scout ships, so that makes it difficult to get a proper notice. If a DM enters an <a href="javaScript:showBox('unexplored');">unexplored system</a>, not only does it not reveal it, but we will be prohibited from entering the offending system.</p>

<p>The one <a href="javaScript:showBox('SC');">Scout</a> that is still alive got <a href="javaScript:showBox('lost')">lost in space</a>... again. Since there was nobody around this time, a d10 was rolled to determine where it went. It moved southwest.</p>

<script>dispImage("lostInSpace2.jpg","Lost In Space... again")</script>

<p>During economics, production (+47 CP), minerals (+10 CP), and maintenance (-1 CP) have taken place. A <a href="javaScript:showBox('space wreck')">space wreck</a> was also cashed in, granting <a href="javaScript:showBox('attack')">Attack</a> tech level 2. Next, <a href="javaScript:showBox('terraforming')">Terraforming</a> tech (-25 CP) was purchased. Finally, 3 <a href="javaScript:showBox('CO');">Colony Ships</a> (-24 CP) and 1 Scout (-6 CP) were built, with one of the former being placed at the forward base. Admittedly, economics-related choices probably weren't the best choice given our remaining time. Still, this leaves 2 CP leftover.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(6)</script>

<h2 id="ep7">Up to Economic Phase 7</h2>

<p>With two <a href="javaScript:showBox('SC');">Scout</a>s on the board, we figured we could get away with exploring the rest of the map. Correct? Nope, one last <a href="javaScript:showBox('danger')">danger</a> hex claims one. <a href="javaScript:showBox('miner')">Mining Ships</a> are working as best as they can to cash in any known <a href="javaScript:showBox('minerals')">minerals</a> that are still floating around. Even then, with the last of the <a href="javaScript:showBox('movement turn')">movement turns</a> exhausted, we have officially ran out of time. The <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM2');">first Doomsday Machine</a> has appeared on the map.</p>

<p>During economics, production (+53 CP), minerals (+10 CP), and maintenance (-1 CP) have taken place. Next, <a href="javaScript:showBox('SY');">Ship Yard</a> tech level 2 (-20 CP) was purchased; probably something that could have been done a phase ago. Finally, 3 <a href="javaScript:showBox('CA');">Cruisers</a> (-36 CP) were built, with one of them being placed at the forward base. This leaves 8 CP leftover.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(7)</script>

<h2 id="ep8">Up to Economic Phase 8</h2>

<p>With the <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM2');">first Doomsday Machine</a> on the move, the best we could do was scramble the 3 <a href="javaScript:showBox('CA');">Cruisers</a> into one spot. Fortunately, the final <a href="javaScript:showBox('SC');">Scout</a> had proven more useful than credit was given. It was able to do the first <a href="javaScript:showBox('battle');">battle</a>. Sure, it quickly got destroyed; but it allowed us to learn the victor's <a href="javaScript:showBox('weakness');">weakness</a>... This DM was weak to <a href="javaScript:showBox('mines');">mines</a>.</p>

<p>Then it ended up being the cruiser's turn to defend. They were able to do 2 hits before 1 of them <a href="javaScript:showBox('retreat');">retreated</a>... which wasn't enough, as the DM was able to destroy the planet and regain its strength. Each planet a DM destroys repairs 2 damage.</p>

<p>With this weakness learned, production (+52 CP), minerals (+15 CP), and maintenance (-2 CP) have taken place. Next, <a href="javaScript:showBox('Minelaying');">Minelaying</a> technology (-20 CP) has been developed. Taking advantage of this purchase, 9 Mines (-45 CP) have been built, using <em>all</em> available <a href="javaScript:showBox('SY');">Ship Yard</a> capacity. And, to open up more options, a Ship Yard (-6 CP) has been built at a third <a href="javaScript:showBox('colony')">colony</a> (J6). This leaves 2 CP leftover.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(8)</script>

<h2 id="ep9">Up to Economic Phase 9</h2>

<p>The <a href="javaScript:showBox('mines');">Mines</a> were immediately scrambled to assist a planet in defense. Yet, while it is true this <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM2');">Doomsday Machine</a> has a weakness, they still are not as weak as a regular ship is. Each mine has a 50% chance (5 or less) to deal 1 damage point to a DM weak to them. We would figure these mines would do good damage to the DM? Nope, only 1 of the 9 mines actually did any damage to them. Granted, the DM was able to destroy 3 <a href="javaScript:showBox('planet')">planets</a> in a single economic phase, allowing it to more than top off its strength.</p>

<p>As if that wasn't enough, this is the <a href="javaScript:showBox('economic phase')">economic phase</a> in which a <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM4');">second Doomsday Machine</a> would appear on the board. With 3 <a href="javaScript:showBox('colony')">colonies</a> destroyed, income has been greatly reduced to just +39 CP (plus +10 from minerals). On the other hand, with no combat ships in service, there is no maintenance to pay. 6 more Mines would be built (-30 CP), along with a <a href="javaScript:showBox('base');">Base</a> (-12 CP) at a key planet to, perhaps, damage the DM now that it has a lot less food to eat, so to speak. There are 9 CP leftover.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(9)</script>

<h2 id="ep11">Up to Economic Phase 11</h2>

<p>Admittedly, this was a point where it was just getting late in the night; plus, multiple distractions had taken place. Two <a href="javaScript:showBox('economic phase')">economic phases</a> were accidentally condensed into one.</p>

<p>Regardless, while the <a href="javaScript:showBox('base');">Base</a> wasn't able to do much, the next batch of 6 mines had proven extremely effective (5 hits dealt). Sure, it was still able to destroy 2 <a href="javaScript:showBox('planet')">planets</a>, but it kept 3 damage points.</p>

<p>Because of the accident that had taken place, a <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM6');">third Doomsday Machine</a> technically appeared one economic phase later than it should have. Reconstructing Economic Phase 10, production has taken place (+33 CP). Next, <a href="javaScript:showBox('defense');">Defense</a> tech level 1 (-20 CP) was purchased. Finally, a <a href="javaScript:showBox('base');">Base</a> (-12 CP) was built at the <a href="javaScript:showBox('homeworld')">homeworld</a>, along with 2 <a href="javaScript:showBox('mines');">Mines</a> (-10 CP). There is 0 CP leftover.</p>

<hr />

<p>Resuming movement, the <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM2');">first DM</a> assaults the homeworld. The mines and the Base were able to destroy it, but not until after having lost 3 of the 4 <a href="javaScript:showBox('SY');">Ship Yard</a>s.</p>

<p>Without any food nearby, the <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM4');">second DM</a> heads for the homeworld next. It ends its final <a href="javaScript:showBox('movement turn')">movement turn</a> 1 hex away. Economic Phase 11 production has taken place (+35 CP), and <a href="javaScript:showBox('defense');">Defense</a> tech level 2 (-30 CP) was purchased to upgrade the Base; leaving 5 CP leftover.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(11)</script>

<h2 id="finale">The Finale</h2>
<p>With not much left to do, all that remained was to just let the <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM4');">second Doomsday Machine</a> assault the homeworld. Since this was its first <a href="javaScript:showBox('battle');">battle</a>, <a href="javaScript:showBox('weakness');">weakness</a> was rolled for. This DM had no weakness. Still, thanks to a lucky burst of at least 8 misses <span class="bindTxt">(8 - 3 - 2 = 3 to hit the base)</span>, the <a href="javaScript:showBox('base');">starbase</a> was able to deal 4 hits <span class="bindTxt">(7 + 2 - 2 = 7 to hit the DM)</span> before it <em>finally</em> got destroyed. With no defenders left, the homeworld got destroyed; ending the scenario in defeat. Overall, choices definitely could have been made better, but this was started somewhat late in the night to be fair. If this scenario gets attempted again, we likely will fall back to Easy difficulty; slightly slowing the pace down and reducing the strength of each DM.</p>

<p>One other element we are noticing a disagreement is whether non-combat ships are allowed to enter <a href="javaScript:showBox('asteroids')">asteroid belts</a>, <a href="javaScript:showBox('nebula')">nebulae</a>, or <a href="javaScript:showBox('black hole')">black holes</a> that have been previously explored. We thought this couldn't be done, but the rulebook doesn't say anything about this limitation, only <a href="javaScript:showBox('unexplored');">unexplored systems</a> and systems containing hostiles are explicitly off limits without an escort.</p>

<p>It is also worth mentioning this playthrough was done with First Edition rules. Later editions reduced the cost of many <a href="javaScript:showBox('tech')">technologies</a>... except <a href="javaScript:showBox('minelaying')">mine laying</a>; its cost went <em>up</em> instead.</p>
