<h2>Alien Empires Summary</h2>
<p>Due to the <b>huge</b> size of the Alien Empires playthrough, we have decided to break the playthrough down into chapters.</p>

<h3><a href="ch1/">Chapter 1 - Early Economics</a></h3>
<p>This chapter has been tailored to introduce new / less experienced players to the board game. As a result, it has been given the greatest amount of detail over the course of just 2 economic phases.</p>

<h3><a href="ch2/">Chapter 2 - Pre-launch gameplay</a></h3>
<p>This chapter contains economic phases 3 - 7, ending just after the Alien Players finally launch their fleets.</p>

<h3><a href="ch3/">Chapter 3 - The battle for deep space</a></h3>
<p>This chapter contains economic phases 8 - 11, ending with attempting the first assault to the Green Alien Player homeworld of Chulak.</p>

<h3><a href="ch4/">Chapter 4 - The assault of Chulak</a></h3>
<p>This chapter contains economic phases 12 - 17, covering continued assaults of the Green Alien Player homeworld of Chulak.</p>
