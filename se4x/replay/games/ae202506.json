With plenty of playthroughs under our belt, we have decided a rematch with Hard difficulty was in order, only we are doing this on the Regular map.</p><p>We will also take advantage of the Close Encounters supplementary gimmicks that are available to the Regular and Large-sized Alien Empires maps. Experience, boarding ships, security forces, ground units, and titans are fair game to both sides. Alien Technology is available exclusively to the human player, if they choose to buy one for 10 CP each time they first colonize a barren planet. The human player can also choose to start with 1 Flagship, but with only the default equipment. Since this is still a non-VP scenario, all other mechanics work as similiarly to vanilla Alien Empires as possible.</p>",

	"commentary":"<p>With Chulak having been glassed, that leaves us with no Alien Players left. This was certainly the most suspenseful, but also the most successful, Alien Empires playthrough we have yet recorded.</p><p>Conquering Hard difficulty for the first time was, well, hard. We have previously done playthroughs where Alien Players got 10 CP each economic roll, but it usually proved to be too much. Worse is that we are only half way done with completion of non-VP Alien Empires; there is a Harder difficulty where we have to put up with 3 Alien Players at 10 CP per economic roll; never mind two even tougher difficulties where 2-3 alien players can generate <b>15</b> CP per roll! While VP variants only allow a fixed 2 alien players, harder difficulties still give them more CP per roll <i>and</i> reduce the VP quota for their team.</p><p>Truly though, one of the reasons we even made it as far as we did was because the alien players never bought Movement technology. Either their rolls kept missing, or they did not have the tech CP at the time of fleet launch, or their homeworld was being beseiged. Then again, part of the charm of Alien Empires as a whole; with the random factor that vastly affects <i>each</i> alien player, it makes each playthrough different than the one before it. So far, we have <i>still</i> seen no Cloaking tech and, therefore, no raider fleets.</p><p>Most recently, we have received word from the official Space Empires 4X <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/d9b1cafc22e4/may-22-update-from-gmt-new-p500s-progress-update-new-digital-games-production-update-art-samples-and-more?e=ec70d85fcf\" target=\"_blank\">newsletter</a> that All Good Things and reprints will be unleashed fairly soon, with an estimated goal of early July. What a fitting opportunity to ease up a bit, maybe take a breather; and see what is in store.</p>{techTable}",
