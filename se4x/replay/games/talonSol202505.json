For the first time, we try our hand at Talon, a faster-paced game that typically covers a single battle; as opposed to Space Empires 4X's galactic conquest. We augment our Replay Center with new functionality to facilitate this playthrough.</p><p>We also take advantage of the possibilities that come with Talon 1000. This expansion adds many new possibilities, while adding relatively little complexity. This gives Talon an advantage that Space Empires 4X does not have. In this case, we opt to play as the Talon themselves, who were antagonists in the vanilla lore; and we are playing against the even more antagonistic AI.</p><p>Since this is our first adventure, we have hand picked the setup for this Green difficulty skirmish. No terrain is present on this map. With the 250 SP that were granted to each faction, we get 1 Light Cruiser and 1 Battlecruiser-X, while the AI gets 5 Destroyers. Forces have been set up in the respective deployment zones (only that the AI takes the place of the Terran faction), and we are ready to begin.</p>",
