Instead of generating CP, each colony they have fully developed (homeworld included) automatically produces <i>1</i> hull. For this economic phase, they will also buy an extra hull at their homeworld, using 8 of the CP they got when they cashed in 35 CP worth of minerals.</p><p>If this scenario was against another regular empire, we might let Scouts do deep space reconnaissance. However, there are plenty of hazards and opportunities to keep an eye peeled, plus the Replicators expansion has introduced some new terrain as well. And since the Replicators themselves automatically collect space wrecks as well (gaining RP in the process), we need to shoot for Exploration Cruisers as soon as we can. Fortunately, merely having a Repllicator faction in our playthrough causes us to begin with 10 CP, instead of the usual 0. Their presence also allows us to colonize our home system barren planet without Terraforming 1. Since Troops are also enabled, we also begin the playthrough with Troops 1.</p><p>Thus, for this first economic phase, we will buy Ship Size 2 (-10) and Exploration 1 (-15) right away. And since we have a barrage of minerals, we will go on ahead and buy 1 Miner (-5). Leftover Ship Yard capacity is used to buy Pipelines (-9).</p>",
