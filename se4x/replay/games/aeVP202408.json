	"commentary":"<p>Welcome to Alien Empires meets Victory Points. This Close Encounters scenario uses the entire map layout, as the objectives have become much more complicated than previous playthroughs. The human player must destroy (or capture) 2 Alien Player homeworlds, while protecting their own home planet and the Galactic Capitol from the same outcomes; <i>and</i> preventing the Alien Team from securing a VP quota (which varies by difficulty setting). On Easy difficulty, the Alien Team needs 13 VP to win. Higher difficulties reduce this quota.</p>{vpTable}<p>Nearly every rule is used (or otherwise useable), including non-player aliens, experience, and ground units. Even with only empire advantages and facilities explicitly prohibited, this makes Alien Empires VP the most complex solo scenario so far throughout Space Empires 4X + expansions, when going by rules used. Still, despite the complexity in decision making regarding CP spending; Alien Player fleet mechanics are otherwise exceptionally simple compared to Replicator fleet mechanics in its <a href=\"watch.htm?replay=rep202407\">solitaire scenario</a>.</p><p>On the subject of technology, all players begin the scenario with Terraforming 1 and Exploration 1, on top of any technologies a respective player would normally start. Additionally, because the Galactic Capitol is present as an objective, a Trade and Research agreement was formed before the scenario even began. As a result, we can develop Black Hole Jumping (denoted in the tech table as simply BHJ) this playthrough; and can tow their respawnable dense minerals to our colonies. Finally, technologies introduced in the Replicators expansion are available exclusively to the human player, though we may err on the side of simplicity and omit them.</p>",
