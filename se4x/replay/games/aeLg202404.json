Still, Blue Player still has a hidden fleet, and it just entered battle for the first time. The fleet has 40 CP assigned, which normally would give them a full Carrier. But, because we revealed Point-Defense technology, Blue Player will no longer automatically build Carrier fleets when able, nor will they give their Fighter tech increased priority. Instead, Blue rolled a 10 to decide whether or not they will build Carriers anyway (skip &gt;4).</p><p>With the Carrier plan spoiled, Blue now spends its 40 Tech CP. Their Ship Size is already at level 3. They roll a 10 (skip &gt;6), so that brings them to the <q>rest of the techs</q> step. They roll a 7 (Scanning level 2, for 20 CP), followed by a 4 (Defense level 1, also for 20 CP). This spends all of their Tech CP.</p><p>And now for fleet construction. The biggest ship they are able to build is a Cruiser (-12 CP). They also have Scanning tech superior to our (lack of) Cloaking tech, so they also build a Destroyer (-9 CP). For composition, they roll a 1 (Largest Fleet). With 19 CP leftover, that gives them 3 Scouts (-18 CP).</p><ol><li><b>Round 1</b>: We have 8 Scouts to their 5 ships.

Since Tech CP was spent earlier this stage, we will simply go straight to construction with the 72 assigned Fleet CP. The biggest ship they can build is now the Cruiser (-12 CP). The Destroyer step is skipped, because they have no Scanning technology. They roll a 5 (Balanced), which equates to 5 more Cruisers (-60 CP) to take advantage of the Attack technology. This spends all of their assigned money.</p><ol><li><b>Round 1</b>: They have 6 Cruisers to our 1 Ship Yard, giving them the Fleet Size Bonus</li><li>Our 1 Ship Yard has the Tactics advantage, so it gets to shoot for.
