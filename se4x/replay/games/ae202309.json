	"commentary":"<p>Welcome to the Space Empires 4X Alien Empires playthrough. This playthrough showcases beating down the Alien Players, hopefully without losing one's own homeworld.</p><p>This playthrough also initially doubles as a walkthrough on playing the first economic phase(s) of a Space Empires 4X game. Ship movement, reconnaissance, and economic management are covered in greater detail at first.</p><p>A typical homeworld setup consists of the homeworld, 4 Ship Yards, 3 Scouts, 3 Colony Ships, and 1 Mining Ship (shown on the board as a Miner). Surrounding their home hex (in this case, L7) is a series of unexplored systems. Early on, that is where the Scouts come in, as they are the least expensive combat ship to build.</p><p>Some of these unexplored systems have a border matching a player's color (in this case, blue). These represent the home systems surrounding a homeworld. Past this neighborhood is a series of deep space systems, depicted with a white border. (Small tip: Starting forces counters can be packed together with the home system markers in between games to save setup time.)</p><hr /><p>In a competitive scenario, players use d10 dice to determine who goes first. This applies only to the first economic phase's worth of turns. A player may attempt to steal or keep the initiative by placing a bid during the next closest economic phase.</p><p>Since this playthrough follows an Alien Empires solo scenario (Normal difficulty), the player strictly goes first. There is no need to bid CP.</p>",
