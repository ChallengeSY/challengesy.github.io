	"commentary":"<p>Welcome to the first AP Bot solitaire adventure, introduced in All Good Things. This expansion introduces the most complex AI system the Space Empires Anthology has seen, able to play on <i>nearly any</i> versus map. Considering that AGT is the capstone expansion, it is truly fitting that the team went out with a <b>bang</b>!</p><p>AP bots are kinda a hybrid when it comes to initial activity. Loosely resembling Doomsday Machines, AP bots are relatively <q>sendentary</q> for a given period of time. In this case; AP bots activate on economic phase 5, <i>or</i> if a human ship gets within 2 hexes of their home systems; whichever comes first. In return, they start with a fixed 150 CP, budgeted as shown in the table below.</p>{botTable}<p>They also have a number of economic rolls based on the difficulty and homeworld setup. Since we are using 20 CP homeworlds and without using facilities, the AP bot normally starts with 6 home system economic rolls. Since this is our very first adventure, we are starting with Easy difficulty (-1 roll). Thus, they start with just 5 rolls. They can temporarily gain home system rolls by cashing in deep space minerals; and also gain deep space rolls by making use of any Terraforming technology they may research. Finally, we flip a coin to determine who would go first, once they launch their first ships. Heads, we gain the initiative!</p>",

Damaging/destroying their colonies has a profound impact on their ability to sustain fleets, especially on lower difficulty settings where they get <i>fewer</i> home system economic rolls. On top of that, sufficiently small maps (at most 2 rows of deep space) effectively cap their income, as the value of Terraforming technology becomes next to non-existant; making deep space economic rolls unobtainable.</p><p>Since this was our first adventure, we made no assumptions on how easy or difficult it would be. Not all scenarios are created equal throughout the Space Empires Anthology. Still, we opted to scale back on complexity where we could. Whenever we do another one, we probably will add some complexity back into the mixture.</p>",
