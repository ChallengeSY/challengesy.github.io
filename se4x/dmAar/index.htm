<h2 id="intro">AAR Intro: A doomed journey</h2>
<p>Welcome to an After Action Report (or simply an AAR) of a Space Empires 4X Doomsday Machine solitaire scenario, played on Normal difficulty. The objective of this scenario is to destroy 3 Doomsday Machines while protecting the homeworld. If any machine reaches the homeworld, any defending ships present will have one last chance to destroy the machine. If they fail, the homeworld becomes destroyed, ending the scenario in defeat for the player.</p>

<script>dispImage("doomsdayMachine.jpg","Doomsday Machine counter")</script>

<p>A typical homeworld setup consists of the home colony, 4 Ship Yards, 3 Scouts, 3 Colony Ships, and 1 Mining Ship. Surrounding their home hex is a series of unexplored systems. Ideally, that is where the Scouts come in, as they are the least expensive combat ship to build.</p>

<p>Some of these unexplored systems have a border matching a player's color. These represent the home systems surrounding a homeworld. Past this neighborhood is a series of deep space systems, depicted with a white border.</p>

<script>dispImage("homeworldSetup.jpg","Typical homeworld setup")</script>

<h2 id="ep1">Up to Economic Phase 1</h2>
<p>The <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM2');">first machine</a> will not appear for 7 economic phases on Normal difficulty. Ideally, this time should be used to build a fleet able to destroy these machines and achieve victory.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(0)</script>

<p>Most of the systems uncovered during reconnaissance are minerals (5 CP each). A single planet (L8) and asteroid belt (K6) were also discovered, each 1 hex away from the homeworld. The former allows use of one of the Colony Ships. Finally; venturing into deep space early, a super nova was discovered, inhibiting further reconnaissance.</p>

<p>During the economic phase, production (+20 CP) and maintenance (-3 CP) have taken place. One of the minerals was also towed home (+5 CP). Next, Ship Size technology level 2 was purchased (-10 CP). Afterwards, 2 more Scouts (-12 CP) were built, leaving a leftover balance of 0 CP.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(1)</script>

<h2 id="ep2">Up to Economic Phase 2</h2>
<p>After coming off to a great start, more reconnaissance takes place, uncovering a variety of system types, including the first rich minerals (10 CP each), nebulae, barren planets. Tragedy also struck this set of turns, exposing the first two Danger! hexes of the playthrough... instantly destroying 2 Scouts (1 in each). One more planet was discovered, allowing use of another Colony Ship.</p>

<script>dispImage("firstDanger.jpg","First Danger marker")</script>

<p>During the economic phase, production (+21 CP), minerals (+5 CP), and maintenance (-3 CP) have taken place. Afterwards, 1 Scout (-6 CP), 1 Mining Ship (-5 CP), and 1 Colony Ship (-8 CP) were built, leaving a leftover balance of 4 CP.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(2)</script>

<h2 id="ep3">Up to Economic Phase 3</h2>

<p>Although it is fortunate to still have 4 Scouts to work with, the recent losses have certainly slowed down reconnaissance. Many home systems remain unexplored as we speak. Yet, reconnaissance remains relatively fruitful, having exposed a space wreck in the process...</p>

<p>... followed by one of the Scouts being lost in space. This was one of the areas where it was unclear how to handle it, since this is a solitaire scenario. For this one, a random spectator was given the opportunity to send this ship, and they moved it northwest of the offending hex. In other news, 2 more Scouts bite the dust to Danger hexes, and multiple planets were discovered, greatly opening up colonization options.</p>

<script>dispImage("lostInSpace1.jpg","Lost In Space")</script>

<p>During economics, production (+24 CP), minerals (+10 CP), and maintenance (-2 CP) have taken place. 3 Scouts (-18 CP), and 2 Colony Ships (-16 CP) were built, leaving a leftover balance of 2 CP. (In hindsight, this wouldn't been legal at the time due to only 4 Ship Yard capacity. We had forgotten about this capacity limit at the time.)</p>

<script>ecoPhase(3)</script>

<h2 id="ep4">Up to Economic Phase 4</h2>

<p>With the <a href="javaScript:showBox('SC');">Scouts</a> rebuilt, more possibilities await... at least, if two more danger hexes weren't exposed over the course of this set of turns.</p>

<p>Just before those incidents took place, the first black hole hex was found. Although a persistant hazard, at least it does not guarantee destruction. Sure enough, a 4 was rolled on this. Compared to a 6 or less, the Scout lived to see another turn... even if it got destroyed the next turn.</p>

<script>dispImage("blackHole.jpg","First Black Hole marker")</script>

<p>During economics, production (+30 CP), minerals (+5 CP), and maintenance (-3 CP) have taken place. Next, Ship Size level 3 was purchased (-15 CP). Afterwards, 1 Colony Ship (-8 CP) was built at the homeworld, while 1 Ship Yard (-6 CP) was built at a nearby <a href="javaScript:showBox('colony')">colony</a> (J8) to act as a forward station. This leaves 5 CP leftover.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(4)</script>

<h2 id="ep5">Up to Economic Phase 5</h2>

<p>During movement, a few more systems get explored, including another danger hex claiming one Scout, and a black hole claiming another (9 &gt; 6). Perhaps most usefully, one of the Mining Ships is towing a space wreck. This will take a bit longer before it can be cashed in.</p>

<p>During economics, production (+38 CP), and maintenance (-1 CP) have taken place. Next, Attack</a> tech level 1 (-20 CP) and Tactics tech level 1 (-15 CP) were purchased. Finally, 1 Ship Yard (-6 CP) was built at the very same <a href="javaScript:showBox('colony')">colony</a> at J8, doubling the forward colony's construction capacity. This leaves 1 CP leftover.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(5)</script>

<h2 id="ep6">Up to Economic Phase 6</h2>

<p>We are low on time at this point in the playthrough before the <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM2');">first</a> Doomsday Machine appears on the map. We are also low on scout ships, so that makes it difficult to get a proper notice. If a DM enters an unexplored system, not only does it not reveal it, but we will be prohibited from entering the offending system.</p>

<p>The one Scout that is still alive got lost in space... again. Since there was nobody around this time, a d10 was rolled to determine where it went. It moved southwest.</p>

<script>dispImage("lostInSpace2.jpg","Lost In Space... again")</script>

<p>During economics, production (+47 CP), minerals (+10 CP), and maintenance (-1 CP) have taken place. A space wreck was also cashed in, granting Attack tech level 2. Next, Terraforming tech (-25 CP) was purchased. Finally, 3 Colony Ships (-24 CP) and 1 Scout (-6 CP) were built, with one of the former being placed at the forward base. Admittedly, economics-related choices probably weren't the best choice given our remaining time. Still, this leaves 2 CP leftover.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(6)</script>

<h2 id="ep7">Up to Economic Phase 7</h2>

<p>With two Scouts on the board, we figured we could get away with exploring the rest of the map. Correct? Nope, one last danger hex claims one. Mining Ships are working as best as they can to cash in any known minerals that are still floating around. Even then, with the last of the turns exhausted, we have officially ran out of time. The <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM2');">first machine</a> has appeared on the map.</p>

<p>During economics, production (+53 CP), minerals (+10 CP), and maintenance (-1 CP) have taken place. Next, Ship Yard tech level 2 (-20 CP) was purchased; probably something that could have been done a phase ago. Finally, 3 Cruisers (-36 CP) were built, with one of them being placed at the forward base. This leaves 8 CP leftover.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(7)</script>

<h2 id="ep8">Up to Economic Phase 8</h2>

<p>With the <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM2');">first machine</a> on the move, the best we could do was scramble the 3 Cruisers into one spot. Fortunately, the final Scout had proven more useful than credit was given. It was able to do the first battle. Sure, it quickly got destroyed; but it allowed us to learn the victor's weakness... This DM was weak to <a href="javaScript:showBox('mines');">mines</a>.</p>

<p>Then it ended up being the Cruiser's turn to defend. They were able to do 2 hits before 1 of them retreated... which wasn't enough, as the DM was able to destroy the planet and regain its strength. Each planet a DM destroys repairs 2 damage.</p>

<p>With this weakness learned, production (+52 CP), minerals (+15 CP), and maintenance (-2 CP) have taken place. Next, Minelaying technology (-20 CP) has been developed. Taking advantage of this purchase, 9 Mines (-45 CP) have been built, using <em>all</em> available Ship Yard capacity. And, to open up more options, a Ship Yard (-6 CP) has been built at a third <a href="javaScript:showBox('colony')">colony</a> (J6). This leaves 2 CP leftover.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(8)</script>

<h2 id="ep9">Up to Economic Phase 9</h2>

<p>The <a href="javaScript:showBox('mines');">Mines</a> were immediately scrambled to assist a planet in defense. Yet, while it is true this <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM2');">machine</a> has a weakness, they still are not as weak as a regular ship is. Each mine has a 50% chance (5 or less) to deal 1 damage point to a DM weak to them. We would figure these mines would do good damage to the DM? Nope, only 1 of the 9 mines actually did any damage to them. Granted, the DM was able to destroy 3 planets in a single economic phase, allowing it to more than top off its strength.</p>

<p>As if that wasn't enough, this is the economic phase in which a <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM4');">second machine</a> would appear on the board. With 3 colonies destroyed, income has been greatly reduced to just +39 CP (plus +10 from minerals). On the other hand, with no combat ships in service, there is no maintenance to pay. 6 more Mines would be built (-30 CP), along with a Base (-12 CP) at a key planet to, perhaps, damage the DM now that it has a lot less food to eat, so to speak. There are 9 CP leftover.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(9)</script>

<h2 id="ep11">Up to Economic Phase 11</h2>

<p>Admittedly, this was a point where it was just getting late in the night; plus, multiple distractions had taken place. Two economic phases were accidentally condensed into one.</p>

<p>Regardless, while the Base wasn't able to do much, the next batch of 6 mines had proven extremely effective (5 hits dealt). Sure, it was still able to destroy 2 planets, but it kept 3 damage points.</p>

<p>Because of the accident that had taken place, a <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM6');">third machine</a> technically appeared one economic phase later than it should have. Reconstructing Economic Phase 10, production has taken place (+33 CP). Next, Defense tech level 1 (-20 CP) was purchased. Finally, a Base (-12 CP) was built at the homeworld, along with 2 Mines (-10 CP). There is 0 CP leftover.</p>

<hr />

<p>Resuming moves, the <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM2');">first DM</a> assaults the homeworld. The mines and the Base were able to destroy it, but not until after having lost 3 of the 4 Ship Yards.</p>

<p>Without any food nearby, the <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM4');">second DM</a> heads for the homeworld next. It ends its final turn 1 hex away. Economic Phase 11 production has taken place (+35 CP), and Defense tech level 2 (-30 CP) was purchased to upgrade the Base; leaving 5 CP leftover.</p>

<script>ecoPhase(11)</script>

<h2 id="finale">The Finale</h2>
<p>With not much left to do, all that remained was to just let the <a href="javaScript:showBox('DM4');">second DM</a> assault the homeworld. Since this was its first battle, weakness was rolled for. This DM had no weakness. Still, thanks to a lucky burst of at least 8 misses <span class="bindTxt">(8 - 3 - 2 = 3 to hit the base)</span>, the Base was able to deal 4 hits <span class="bindTxt">(7 + 2 - 2 = 7 to hit the DM)</span> before it <em>finally</em> got destroyed. With no defenders left, the homeworld got destroyed; ending the scenario in defeat. Overall, choices definitely could have been made better, but this was started somewhat late in the night to be fair.</p>

<p>One other element we are noticing a disagreement is whether non-combat ships are allowed to enter asteroid belts, nebulae, or black holes that have been previously explored. We thought this couldn't be done, but the rulebook doesn't say anything about this limitation, only unexplored systems and systems containing hostiles are explicitly off limits without an escort.</p>

<p>It is also worth mentioning this playthrough was done with First Edition rules. Later editions reduced the cost of many technologies... except Minelaying; its cost went <em>up</em> instead.</p>
