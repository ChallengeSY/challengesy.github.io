<h2>Basic Instructions</h2>
<p>The rules of SoaKer are rather complex. The player is given six colored dice to roll, and is to score as high as they can with a finite number of turns and rolls. In between rolls, the player can keep dice (by tapping on one to toggle its lock state).</p>

<p>After up to three rolls are completed, a turn ends by choosing a combination (or simply combo) and recording a score <i>or</i> a zero (by tapping on the desired score box).</p>

<h2>Available Combinations</h2>
<p>Upper Section combos are scored simply by counting up the number of dice that corrospond to the chosen combo. A bonus of +40 is awarded if at least 74 points can be scored in this field.</p>

<p>The Lower Section comprises of X of a Kind (X dice of the same numeral) and Yarborough (any dice combination can score). Five of a Kind also offers a same color bonus.</p>

<p>Middle Section is probably the most complex section in the game. Three Pair should be self-explainatory, while Two Trios can be explained by constituting each Three of a Kind as a trio. These two combos also offer a same color bonus. The straights are simply comprised of a sequence of numbers.</p>

<h2>Joker System</h2>
<p>If a Six of a Kind has been rolled, and the corrosponding box has already been scored, then a joker may be applied to any Middle or Lower Section entry (complete with a color bonus if applicable). A SoaK bonus (100 points each) is also provided <i>if</i> the Six of a Kind box did not have a zero assigned to it. If an Upper Section box is scored, then the usual scoring is applied instead.</p>
