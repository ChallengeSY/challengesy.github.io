<p>Welcome to the <strong>Nevergalaxy</strong>, a collection of <a href="https://neverball.org/">Neverball</a> and Neverputt sub-projects.</p>

<h2>Sub-project List</h2>

<h3><a href="clockwork/">Neverball Clockwork</a></h3>
<p>Neverball Clockwork was the primary Neverball project at one point. Introducing collectible clocks to the game, it opened the door for more level design.</p>

<p>The code has since been included in the core game. The 50 levels comprising of the pioneer level sets can still be downloaded and integrated into any compatible build.</p>

<h3><a href="puttworks/">Puttworks Courses</a></h3>
<p>Puttworks Courses comprises of two courses of varying difficulty. A few wacky concepts are present in these courses.</p>

<h3><a href="curveUI/">curveUI</a></h3>
<p>curveUI is a front-end for the official curve program. Although it doesn't do complex curves justice, being able to visualize a curve <em>before</em> generating it can be useful.</p>

<h3><a href="mapcUI/">curveUI</a></h3>
<p>mapcUI is a front-end for the official mapc program. It is able to perform batch compilations of map folders.</p>

<h3><a href="random/">Legacy random courses</a></h3>
<p>We experimented with random course <q>tournaments</q> back in 2014. The experiment did not work, due to multiple issues. We have left the courses here as a small bit of history.</p>
