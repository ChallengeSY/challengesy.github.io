<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Difficulty Slider system</h3>
<p>The difficulty is set on a decimal system, allowing for a lot of flexibility. The system also comes equipped with a Handicap system, allowing local hotseat matches to play on different settings.</p>

<h3>Password/Level select system</h3>
<p>A majority of the included levels (but not all) come with a password. A level select system is also included, virtually eliminating the need to remember passwords. These can be used to start a more casual playthrough at a later start point than the first level.</p>

<h3>Per-level variation system</h3>
<p>Each level can be customized with their own variations. Some variations are obvious, while others are not as obvious.</p>

<h3>Level Editor</h3>
<p>The included level editor can be used to build more levels. Although the controls are not that simple, it is still fairly flexible. Block <q>brushes</q> are on a per-level basis, and connections can be established to build multi-hits and/or invincible blocks</p>
