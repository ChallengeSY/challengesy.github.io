<p>Project Cleansing is a Title Pack for ShootMania Storm; containing a cooperative game mode, dubbed Cleansing.</p>
<p>The objective of the Cleansing team (human players) is to capture all goal posts <em>before</em> time expires. There are a few complications; most goal posts are guarded by turrets, and gold nuggets (acquired from dedicated dispensers) are also required to capture a goal post. Finally, if the difficulty is high enough (35%+), there can be a finite number of shared revives that will prohibit further respawns from this team once exhausted.</p>
<p>The Infested team (computers only) is comprised of smaller toads, common 1-armor units that spawn frequently; and cyborgs, durable <q>boss</q> bots (50 - 200 armor) that are resistant to off-zone, but will go down permanently once their armor reaches zero.</p>
