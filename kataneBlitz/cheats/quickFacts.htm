<h2 id="pack0">Vanilla Pack</h2>
<h3>The Button</h3>
<p><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/The Button.html">The Button</a> is probably the simplest solvable vanilla module. Yet, we still found a few quick facts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Yellow button clause is <i>completely</i> redundant. It does not add any new rules that other clauses do <i>not</i> cover.</li>
<li>The "CAR clause" (lit indicator + white button) is only <i>almost</i> redundant. Its unique effects kick in if the "FReaK clause" (lit indicator + &ge;3 batteries) is also in effect.</li>
<li>The white stripe clause is <i>also</i> redundant; it does not introduce any unique rules regarding releasing buttons.</li>
<li>The Button is the only vanilla module that makes use of indicators. It is also the only time-sensitive solvable module.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Complicated Wires</h3>
<p><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Complicated Wires.html">Complicated Wires</a> may seem intimating, but it loses part of its complications (pardon the pun) once these bullets are noted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Complicated Wires uses a single ruleset throughout the bomb. Once what can (and can not be cut) are known on one module, subsequent instances on the same bomb become easier.</li>
<li>Complicated Wires is the only vanilla module that is dependent on the ports present on a bomb.</li>
<li>White means nothing on a complicated wire that is also blue or red. It is useful only when a wire is neither blue nor red.</li>
<li>White featureless wires, White star wires, and Red star wires can <i>always</i> be safely cut, no matter what edgework is on the bomb.</li>
<li>Inversely, White LED wires, Blue star wires, and RedBlue star LED wires can <i>never</i> be cut.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Keypad</h3>
<p>We have found a few quickies for <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Keypad.html">Keypad</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The &copy; and &#1004; symbols are <i>always</i> safely tappable first, because they are consistently the highest priority symbols throughout the module.</li>
<li>Building on the previous bullet, &#1004; and Ó¬ symbols can <i>always</i> be safely tapped in the order shown.</li>
<li>Likewise, &starf; and &Omega; symbols should <i>always</i> be tapped last, because they are consistently the lowest priority symbols throughout the module.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Memory</h3>
<p><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Memory.html">Memory</a> is well up there in complexity. Yet, we have found a few shortcuts.</p>
<ul>
<li>While all 4 stages' labels do need to be remembered, <i>only</i> the first 2 stages' positions need to be remembered.</li>
<li>Positions are important for stages 2 and 4. Labels are important for stages 3 and 5.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Needy Modules</h3>
<p>The available three needy modules have a few fun facts. Some are shared, some are unique.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Capacitor Discharge.html">capacitor</a> overloads, the module will <b>permanently</b> deactivate. Consequently, Katane Blitz intentionally omits blown capacitors when scoring in Endless games.</li>
<li>Other needy modules can reactivate anywhere between 10 and 40 seconds from the last deactivation.</li>
<li><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Knob.html">Knobs</a> are unique among the <q>vanilla</q> needy modules in that it will always run its timer down to zero. When it does, if the arrow is in the correct orientation, the module quietly deactivates. Otherwise, it strikes.</li>
<li><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Venting Gas.html">Venting Gas</a> has a nasty habit of tripping defusers with its questions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Simon Says</h3>
<p><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Simon Says.html">Simon Says</a> is exceptionally simple... in its original package.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the only vanilla module that cares about vowels and strikes. Since Katane Blitz uses lives in place of strikes, it instead treats lives lost as if they were strikes.</li>
<li>Katane Blitz takes advantage of its simplicity and increases its maximum stage limit, based on how many modules have already been disarmed. Each 25 modules increases this by one stage, up to a maximum of 9 stages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who's On First</h3>
<p><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Who's on First.html">Who's on First</a> has a decent amount of complexity. Nonetheless, these facts can be used to optimize this module.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clickable buttons can use phrases from 1 of 2 distinct answer pools.</li>
<li>While Blank and Nothing exist as top labels, there is absolutely no mention of a <q>Null</q> label (although Null and No are somewhat similiar in pronounciation). This could be used to the team's advantage.</li>
<li>Red and Read top labels use the very same (middle right) read position. Same goes for words See and Cee (bottom right); but not single letter C (top right).</li>
<li>All answers past the original phrase are useless because it will always be in the list of 6 answer buttons.</li>
<li>Because the 6 buttons all have to tap into the very same 1 of 2 different answer pools, this means the last 5 answers in a given list will <i>never</i> be used. Even if the original phrase is in the final five.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wires</h3>
<p><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Wires.html">Wires</a> is not exactly a complex module, but it still exposes a few fun facts.</p>
<ul>
<li>When cutting 3 wires; the Last Wire White clause is redundant. <b>If</b> there is a red wire, the last wire will always be the correct wire; <b>except</b> if there are also exactly 2 blue wires. The last blue is the correct wire instead.</li>
<li>When cutting 5 wires; the third and last wires are <i>never</i> the correct wire to cut. The fourth wire can be the correct wire <b>only</b> if the last digit is odd.</li>
<li>Likewise, when cutting 6 wires; the first, second, and fifth wires are <i>never</i> the correct wire to cut. The third wire can be the correct wire <b>only</b> if the last digit is odd.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wire Sequence</h3>
<p><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Wire Sequence.html">Wire Sequence</a> is well up there in complexity, since it requires keeping counts of each of three colors. We found a few quickies nonetheless.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first Black and seventh Red wires are <i>always</i> cuttable.</li>
<li>It is technically possible, though very unlikely, to run into a Wire Sequence with no valid wires. This requires that there be no black wires, and at most 6 red wires.</li>
<li>Contrary to what the manual may suggest, there could be 9 or 10 wires on a single Wire Sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other solvable modules</h3>
<p>None of the remaining modules bring much to the table. They instead belong in this section.</p>
<ul>
<li>None of the 9 possible <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Maze.html">Maze</a> layouts has a circle share positions with another.</li>
<li>Usually the first three characters in a <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Morse Code.html">Morse Code</a> is all it takes to find the correct frequency. Sometimes a solution can be found before then.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Password.html">Password</a>, there can be six characters per column.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pack1">Adjacent Pack modules</h2>
<h3>9-Ball</h3>
<p><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/9-Ball.html">9-Ball</a> (by GhostSalt) is a fairly simple module.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each of the nine object ball slots has a unique potting condition during the <q>break phase</q>, some of which are related to their neighbors.</li>
<li>During the break phase, the order in which compatible balls are potted does not matter.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adjacent Letters</h3>
<p><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Adjacent Letters.html">Adjacent Letters</a> (by Timwi and Lumbud84) is a rather tough add-on module.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each of the twelve letters has a unique set of neighbors that, when present on the appropriate side, necessitate that the key be pressed.</li>
<li>A letter can <q>resonate</q> with one, but not both, requirements of another letter.</li>
<li>Because of its increased difficulty, this module will not appear in Arcade games until 25 modules have already been disarmed. It will also grant time extensions as if 25 fewer modules were disarmed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modulo</h3>
<p><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Modulo.html">Modulo</a> (by Royal_Flu$h) itself is extremely simple. Katane Blitz takes advantage of this and upgrades this module as more modules are disarmed in Arcade games.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, the dividend can range anywhere between 50 and 999, and that the divisor can range from 3 to 15. The respective maximums <i>increase</i> whenever an extra life threshold (each 25 disarms) is reached in an Arcade game.</li>
<li>If at least 50 modules have already been disarmed, there is a small chance this module will upgrade to a <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Cruel Modulo.html">Cruel Modulo</a> (by VFlyer and ktane1). It is also available as a <a href="../play.htm?module=cruelModulo">unique mission</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Switches</h3>
<p><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Switches.html">Switches</a> (by Brian Fetter) is deceptively simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yet, 10 of the possible 32 switch combinations are <i>illegal</i>. This is just over a quarter of the possibilities</li>
<li>The <q>problem</q> and solution are guaranteed to be different by 2 switches <i>minimum</i>.</li>
</ul>
