<h2>Auxilliary News</h2>
<h4>Nevergalaxy back online (Dec 11, 2022)</h4>
<p>Nevergalaxy is back online. Its sub-projects have returned, with the <em>exception</em> of the pre-designed course leaderboards.</p>

<h4>Ionic Merge Labs upgraded and split (Nov 22, 2022)</h4>
<p>Ionic Merge Labs has received a significant upgrade to justify splitting it as a separate project from Campaign Tech Simulator.</p>

<p>Most notably, it is now possible to import Ion Storms from any Planets Nu game, and apply their data directly to the simulation.</p>

<h4>Campaign Tech Simulator overhauled (Nov 16, 2022)</h4>
<p>We have overhauled the Campaign Tech Simulator, taking advantage of the remote data retrieval system to automatically fetch updated data from Planets Nu's server.</p>

<p>The 12 main modules benefit from this overhaul. The Space Dock bonus material (formerly the Parts Builder) also benefitted from this overhaul.</p>

<h4>Wrapsweeper released! (Oct 29, 2022)</h4>
<p>We welcome Wrapsweeper to the list of projects! Wrapsweeper is a Minesweeper with wraparound borders.</p>

<h4>Differentiation Challenge remastered! (Apr 16, 2022)</h4>
<p>After being originally delayed for nearly a year and a half thanks to web host snafus, we have released a new... or, rather, remastered project on this site! Welcome back, Differentiation Challenge!</p>
