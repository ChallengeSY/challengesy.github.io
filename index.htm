<h2>Auxilliary News</h2>
<h4>SE4X Resourcepedia posted (Jan 3, 2023)</h4>
<p>The Space Empires 4X Resourcepedia has been posted, as another sub-collection of resources. Due to the variety of projects, we have split most of them off into a separate <q>Space Yard</q> page.</p>

<h4>Nevergalaxy back online (Dec 11, 2022)</h4>
<p>Nevergalaxy is back online. Its sub-projects have returned, with the <em>exception</em> of the pre-designed course leaderboards.</p>

<h4>Ionic Merge Labs upgraded and split (Nov 22, 2022)</h4>
<p>Ionic Merge Labs has received a significant upgrade to justify splitting it as a separate project from Campaign Tech Simulator.</p>

<p>Most notably, it is now possible to import Ion Storms from any Planets Nu game, and apply their data directly to the simulation.</p>

<h4>Campaign Tech Simulator overhauled (Nov 16, 2022)</h4>
<p>We have overhauled the Campaign Tech Simulator, taking advantage of the remote data retrieval system to automatically fetch updated data from Planets Nu's server.</p>

<p>The 12 main modules benefit from this overhaul. The Space Dock bonus material (formerly the Parts Builder) also benefitted from this overhaul.</p>
